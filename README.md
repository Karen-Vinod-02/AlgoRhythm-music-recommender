# AlgoRhythm

AlgoRhythm is a content-based music recommendation system that uses a rule-based filtering engine to suggest songs based on user input. Users can log in and enter keywords such as mood, genre, or artist into the search bar to receive recommendations from a preloaded CSV dataset.

The system uses hybrid rule-based content filtering system to provide recommendations. Built using Django, it offers a lightweight and extendable web interface for exploring songs by mood, tempo, and genre.
